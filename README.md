# TSP
Our Code for Travelling Saleman Problem for 'Design and Analysis of Algorithum' in Semeter 3

Problem Statement:
A traveler needs to visit all the cities from a list, where distances between all the cities are known and each city should be visited just once. What is the shortest possible route that he visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?

Algorithum:
Herp-Karp Algorithum.
Which Says:
“Every subpath of a path of minimum distance is itself of minimum distance.”

That is :

Compute the solutions of all subproblems starting with the smallest. Whenever computing a solution requires solutions for smaller problems using the above recursive equations, look up these solutions which are already computed. To compute a minimum distance tour, use the final equation to generate the 1st node, and repeat for the other nodes.
